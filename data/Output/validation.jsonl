{"text": "Greedy Algorithms for Cone Constrained Optimization with Convergence Guarantees\n  Greedy optimization methods such as Matching Pursuit (MP) and Frank-Wolfe\n(FW) algorithms regained popularity in recent years due to their simplicity,\neffectiveness and theoretical guarantees. MP and FW address optimization over\nthe linear span and the convex hull of a set of atoms, respectively. In this\npaper, we consider the intermediate case of optimization over the convex cone,\nparametrized as the conic hull of a generic atom set, leading to the first\nprincipled definitions of non-negative MP algorithms for which we give explicit\nconvergence rates and demonstrate excellent empirical performance. In\nparticular, we derive sublinear ($\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$) convergence on general\nsmooth and convex objectives, and linear convergence ($\\mathcal{O}(e^{-t})$) on\nstrongly convex objectives, in both cases for general sets of atoms.\nFurthermore, we establish a clear correspondence of our algorithms to known\nalgorithms from the MP and FW literature. Our novel algorithms and analyses\ntarget general atom sets and general objective functions, and hence are\ndirectly applicable to a large variety of learning settings.\n", "pos": 5.552324523664711}

{"text": "Interpretable Active Learning\n  Active learning has long been a topic of study in machine learning. However,\nas increasingly complex and opaque models have become standard practice, the\nprocess of active learning, too, has become more opaque. There has been little\ninvestigation into interpreting what specific trends and patterns an active\nlearning strategy may be exploring. This work expands on the Local\nInterpretable Model-agnostic Explanations framework (LIME) to provide\nexplanations for active learning recommendations. We demonstrate how LIME can\nbe used to generate locally faithful explanations for an active learning\nstrategy, and how these explanations can be used to understand how different\nmodels and datasets explore a problem space over time. In order to quantify the\nper-subgroup differences in how an active learning strategy queries spatial\nregions, we introduce a notion of uncertainty bias (based on disparate impact)\nto measure the discrepancy in the confidence for a model's predictions between\none subgroup and another. Using the uncertainty bias measure, we show that our\nquery explanations accurately reflect the subgroup focus of the active learning\nqueries, allowing for an interpretable explanation of what is being learned as\npoints with similar sources of uncertainty have their uncertainty bias\nresolved. We demonstrate that this technique can be applied to track\nuncertainty bias over user-defined clusters or automatically generated clusters\nbased on the source of uncertainty.\n", "pos": 5.23406942617422}

However, the outskirts of ETGs\nare thought to be assembled via the slow accumulation of smaller systems in\nwhich the star formation is less extreme; this suggests the form of the IMF\nshould exhibit a radial trend in ETGs.

In essence, it combines the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and\nreverse KL divergences into a unified objective function, thus it exploits the\ncomplementary statistical properties from these divergences to effectively\ndiversify the estimated density in capturing multi-modes. We term our method\ndual discriminator generative adversarial nets (D2GAN) which, unlike GAN, has\ntwo discriminators; and together with a generator, it also has the analogy of a\nminimax game, wherein a discriminator rewards high scores for samples from data\ndistribution whilst another discriminator, conversely, favoring data from the\ngenerator, and the generator produces data to fool both two discriminators.

For that reason the basics for calculus of\nvariations will be introduced in this paper. We have to find a suitable class\nof fields that are admissible for this procedure as they provide unique global\nsolutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system.

{"text": "Some surprises in the neutrino cross sections associated with neutrino spin\n  It is generally assumed that neutrino masses can be neglected to a high\ndegree of approximation in cross section calculations. This assumption seems\nvery reasonable since the neutrino masses are extremely small and the neutrinos\nare ultrarelativistic fermions at the energy scales of current experiments.\nConsequently, in cross section calculations in the Quantum Field Theory, the\nStandard Model neutrinos are frequently assumed to be described by 100%\nnegative helicity states. This assumption is true in a sense that in the\nStandard Model processes the positive helicity states can be safely neglected\nfor ultrarelativistic neutrinos. On the other hand, the assumption tacitly\nassert that the neutrino fields are completely longitudinally polarized, i.e.,\nthe contribution to the cross section coming from transverse polarization can\nbe neglected. We show that this tacit assertion is not correct. Although the\nStandard Model cross section for a neutrino with positive helicity goes to zero\nas m-> 0, the cross section for a neutrino with transverse polarization remains\nfinite in that limit. Thus the contribution coming from transverse polarization\ncannot be neglected even in the ultrarelativistic/zero-mass limit.

{"text": "Three- and four-electron integrals involving Gaussian geminals: fundamental integrals, upper bounds and recurrence relations\n  We report the three main ingredients to calculate three- and four-electron\nintegrals over Gaussian basis functions involving Gaussian geminal operators:\nfundamental integrals, upper bounds, and recurrence relations. In particular,\nwe consider the three- and four-electron integrals that may arise in\nexplicitly-correlated F12 methods. A straightforward method to obtain the\nfundamental integrals is given. We derive vertical, transfer and horizontal\nrecurrence relations to build up angular momentum over the centers. Strong,\nsimple and scaling-consistent upper bounds are also reported. This latest\ningredient allows to compute only the $\\order{N^2}$ significant three- and\nfour-electron integrals, avoiding the computation of the very large number of\nnegligible integrals.\n", "pos": 5.399530935637988}
{"text": "A Stability Theorem for Matchings in Tripartite 3-Graphs\n  It follows from known results that every regular tripartite hypergraph of\npositive degree, with $n$ vertices in each class, has matching number at least\n$n/2$. This bound is best possible, and the extremal configuration is unique.\nHere we prove a stability version of this statement, establishing that every\nregular tripartite hypergraph with matching number at most $(1 +\n\\varepsilon)n/2$ is close in structure to the extremal configuration, where\n\"closeness\" is measured by an explicit function of $\\varepsilon$. We also\nanswer a question of Aharoni, Kotlar and Ziv about matchings in hypergraphs\nwith a more general degree condition.\n", "pos": 5.192906328818886}
{"text": "Barcodes of Towers and a Streaming Algorithm for Persistent Homology\n  A tower is a sequence of simplicial complexes connected by simplicial maps.\nWe show how to compute a filtration, a sequence of nested simplicial complexes,\nwith the same persistent barcode as the tower. Our approach is based on the\nconing strategy by Dey et al. (SoCG 2014). We show that a variant of this\napproach yields a filtration that is asymptotically only marginally larger than\nthe tower and can be efficiently computed by a streaming algorithm, both in\ntheory and in practice. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be combined\nwith a streaming algorithm to compute the barcode of the tower via matrix\nreduction. The space complexity of the algorithm does not depend on the length\nof the tower, but the maximal size of any subcomplex within the tower.\n", "pos": 5.699262197584549}
{"text": "Generative Adversarial Forests for Better Conditioned Adversarial Learning\n  In recent times, many of the breakthroughs in various vision-related tasks\nhave revolved around improving learning of deep models; these methods have\nranged from network architectural improvements such as Residual Networks, to\nvarious forms of regularisation such as Batch Normalisation. In essence, many\nof these techniques revolve around better conditioning, allowing for deeper and\ndeeper models to be successfully learned. In this paper, we look towards better\nconditioning Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in an unsupervised learning\nsetting. Our method embeds the powerful discriminating capabilities of a\ndecision forest into the discriminator of a GAN. This results in a better\nconditioned model which learns in an extremely stable way. We demonstrate\nempirical results which show both clear qualitative and quantitative evidence\nof the effectiveness of our approach, gaining significant performance\nimprovements over several popular GAN-based approaches on the Oxford Flowers\nand Aligned Celebrity Faces datasets.\n", "pos": 5.194639725614925}
{"text": "Thermal Expansion of the Heavy-fermion Superconductor PuCoGa$_{5}$\n  We have performed high-resolution powder x-ray diffraction measurements on a\nsample of $^{242}$PuCoGa$_{5}$, the heavy-fermion superconductor with the\nhighest critical temperature $T_{c}$ = 18.7 K. The results show that the\ntetragonal symmetry of its crystallographic lattice is preserved down to 2 K.\nMarginal evidence is obtained for an anomalous behaviour below $T_{c}$ of the\n$a$ and $c$ lattice parameters. The observed thermal expansion is isotropic\ndown to 150 K, and becomes anisotropic for lower temperatures. This gives a\n$c/a$ ratio that decreases with increasing temperature to become almost\nconstant above $\\sim$150 K. The volume thermal expansion coefficient\n$\\alpha_{V}$ has a jump at $T_{c}$, a factor $\\sim$20 larger than the change\npredicted by the Ehrenfest relation for a second order phase transition. The\nvolume expansion deviates from the curve expected for the conventional\nanharmonic behaviour described by a simple Gr\u00fcneisen-Einstein model. The\nobserved differences are about ten times larger than the statistical error bars\nbut are too small to be taken as an indication for the proximity of the system\nto a valence instability that is avoided by the superconducting state.\n", "pos": 5.275775985411562}
{"text": "Ranking with Adaptive Neighbors\n  Retrieving the most similar objects in a large-scale database for a given\nquery is a fundamental building block in many application domains, ranging from\nweb searches, visual, cross media, and document retrievals. State-of-the-art\napproaches have mainly focused on capturing the underlying geometry of the data\nmanifolds. Graph-based approaches, in particular, define various diffusion\nprocesses on weighted data graphs. Despite success, these approaches rely on\nfixed-weight graphs, making ranking sensitive to the input affinity matrix. In\nthis study, we propose a new ranking algorithm that simultaneously learns the\ndata affinity matrix and the ranking scores. The proposed optimization\nformulation assigns adaptive neighbors to each point in the data based on the\nlocal connectivity, and the smoothness constraint assigns similar ranking\nscores to similar data points. We develop a novel and efficient algorithm to\nsolve the optimization problem. Evaluations using synthetic and real datasets\nsuggest that the proposed algorithm can outperform the existing methods.\n", "pos": 5.549685846466512}
{"text": "Relaxing Exclusive Control in Boolean Games\n  In the typical framework for boolean games (BG) each player can change the\ntruth value of some propositional atoms, while attempting to make her goal\ntrue. In standard BG goals are propositional formulas, whereas in iterated BG\ngoals are formulas of Linear Temporal Logic. Both notions of BG are\ncharacterised by the fact that agents have exclusive control over their set of\natoms, meaning that no two agents can control the same atom. In the present\ncontribution we drop the exclusivity assumption and explore structures where an\natom can be controlled by multiple agents. We introduce Concurrent Game\nStructures with Shared Propositional Control (CGS-SPC) and show that they ac-\ncount for several classes of repeated games, including iterated boolean games,\ninfluence games, and aggregation games. Our main result shows that, as far as\nverification is concerned, CGS-SPC can be reduced to concurrent game structures\nwith exclusive control. This result provides a polynomial reduction for the\nmodel checking problem of specifications in Alternating-time Temporal Logic on\nCGS-SPC.\n", "pos": 5.120646700757731}
{"text": "Nudged elastic band calculations accelerated with Gaussian process regression\n  Minimum energy paths for transitions such as atomic and/or spin\nrearrangements in thermalized systems are the transition paths of largest\nstatistical weight. Such paths are frequently calculated using the nudged\nelastic band method, where an initial path is iteratively shifted to the\nnearest minimum energy path. The computational effort can be large, especially\nwhen ab initio or electron density functional calculations are used to evaluate\nthe energy and atomic forces. Here, we show how the number of such evaluations\ncan be reduced by an order of magnitude using a Gaussian process regression\napproach where an approximate energy surface is generated and refined in each\niteration. When the goal is to evaluate the transition rate within harmonic\ntransition state theory, the evaluation of the Hessian matrix at the initial\nand final state minima can be carried out beforehand and used as input in the\nminimum energy path calculation, thereby improving stability and reducing the\nnumber of iterations needed for convergence. A Gaussian process model also\nprovides an uncertainty estimate for the approximate energy surface, and this\ncan be used to focus the calculations on the lesser-known part of the path,\nthereby reducing the number of needed energy and force evaluations to a half in\nthe present calculations. The methodology is illustrated using the\ntwo-dimensional M\u00fcller-Brown potential surface and performance assessed on an\nestablished benchmark involving 13 rearrangement transitions of a heptamer\nisland on a solid surface.\n", "pos": 5.371083053504382}
