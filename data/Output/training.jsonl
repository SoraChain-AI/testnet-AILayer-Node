{"text": "$M$-QAM Precoder Design for MIMO Directional Modulation Transceivers\n  Spectrally efficient multi-antenna wireless communication systems are a key\nchallenge as service demands continue to increase. At the same time, powering\nup radio access networks is facing environmental and regulation limitations. In\norder to achieve more power efficiency, we design a directional modulation\nprecoder by considering an $M$-QAM constellation, particularly with\n$M=4,8,16,32$. First, extended detection regions are defined for desired\nconstellations using analytical geometry. Then, constellation points are placed\nin the optimal positions of these regions while the minimum Euclidean distance\nto adjacent constellation points and detection region boundaries is kept as in\nthe conventional $M$-QAM modulation. For further power efficiency and symbol\nerror rate similar to that of fixed design in high SNR, relaxed detection\nregions are modeled for inner points of $M=16,32$ constellations. The modeled\nextended and relaxed detection regions as well as the modulation\ncharacteristics are utilized to formulate symbol-level precoder design problems\nfor directional modulation to minimize the transmission power while preserving\nthe minimum required SNR at the destination. In addition, the extended and\nrelaxed detection regions are used for precoder design to minimize the output\nof each power amplifier. We transform the design problems into convex ones and\ndevise an interior point path-following iterative algorithm to solve the\nmentioned problems and provide details on finding the initial values of the\nparameters and the starting point.

{"text": "Adaptive Lock-Free Data Structures in Haskell: A General Method for Concurrent Implementation Swapping\n  A key part of implementing high-level languages is providing built-in and\ndefault data structures.

A mutable data\nstructure's workload is not known in advance, and it may shift over its\nlifetime - e.g., between read-heavy and write-heavy, or from heavy contention\nby multiple threads to single-threaded or low-frequency use. One idea is to\nswitch implementations adaptively, but it is nontrivial to switch the\nimplementation of a concurrent data structure at runtime. Performing the\ntransition requires a concurrent snapshot of data structure contents, which\nnormally demands special engineering in the data structure's design. However,\nin this paper we identify and formalize an relevant property of lock-free\nalgorithms. Namely, lock-freedom is sufficient to guarantee that freezing\nmemory locations in an arbitrary order will result in a valid snapshot. Several\nfunctional languages have data structures that freeze and thaw, transitioning\nbetween mutable and immutable, such as Haskell vectors and Clojure transients,\nbut these enable only single-threaded writers. We generalize this approach to\naugment an arbitrary lock-free data structure with the ability to gradually\nfreeze and optionally transition to a new representation. This augmentation\ndoesn't require changing the algorithm or code for the data structure, only\nreplacing its datatype for mutable references with a freezable variant.

Then, we focus on the virtual scenes\ncomposed of 3D CAD models and study methods for 3D scene analysis and\nprocessing. After that, we survey various modeling paradigms for creating 3D\nindoor scenes and investigate human-centric scene analysis and modeling, which\nbridge indoor scene studies of graphics, vision and robotics. At last, we\ndiscuss open problems in indoor scene processing that might bring interests to\ngraphics and all related communities.\n", "pos": 5.229739368422144}
{"text": "Input to State Stability of Bipedal Walking Robots: Application to DURUS\n  Bipedal robots are a prime example of systems which exhibit highly nonlinear\ndynamics, underactuation, and undergo complex dissipative impacts. This paper\ndiscusses methods used to overcome a wide variety of uncertainties, with the\nend result being stable bipedal walking. The principal contribution of this\npaper is to establish sufficiency conditions for yielding input to state stable\n(ISS) hybrid periodic orbits, i.e., stable walking gaits under model-based and\nphase-based uncertainties. In particular, it will be shown formally that\nexponential input to state stabilization (e-ISS) of the continuous dynamics,\nand hybrid invariance conditions are enough to realize stable walking in the\n23-DOF bipedal robot DURUS.

{"text": "DeepCodec: Adaptive Sensing and Recovery via Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\n  In this paper we develop a novel computational sensing framework for sensing\nand recovering structured signals. When trained on a set of representative\nsignals, our framework learns to take undersampled measurements and recover\nsignals from them using a deep convolutional neural network. In other words, it\nlearns a transformation from the original signals to a near-optimal number of\nundersampled measurements and the inverse transformation from measurements to\nsignals. This is in contrast to traditional compressive sensing (CS) systems\nthat use random linear measurements and convex optimization or iterative\nalgorithms for signal recovery. We compare our new framework with\n$\\ell_1$-minimization from the phase transition point of view and demonstrate\nthat it outperforms $\\ell_1$-minimization in the regions of phase transition\nplot where $\\ell_1$-minimization cannot recover the exact solution.

{"text": "Transferrable End-to-End Learning for Protein Interface Prediction\n  While there has been an explosion in the number of experimentally determined,\natomically detailed structures of proteins, how to represent these structures\nin a machine learning context remains an open research question. In this work\nwe demonstrate that representations learned from raw atomic coordinates can\noutperform hand-engineered structural features while displaying a much higher\ndegree of transferrability. To do so, we focus on a central problem in biology:\npredicting how proteins interact with one another--that is, which surfaces of\none protein bind to which surfaces of another protein. We present Siamese\nAtomic Surfacelet Network (SASNet), the first end-to-end learning method for\nprotein interface prediction. Despite using only spatial coordinates and\nidentities of atoms as inputs, SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods that\nrely on hand-engineered, high-level features. These results are particularly\nstriking because we train the method entirely on a significantly biased data\nset that does not account for the fact that proteins deform when binding to one\nanother.

{"text": "End-of-Use Core Triage in Extreme Scenarios Based on a Threshold Approach\n  Remanufacturing is a significant factor in securing sustainability through a\ncircular economy. Sorting plays a significant role in remanufacturing\npre-processing inspections. Its significance can increase when remanufacturing\nfacilities encounter extreme situations, such as abnormally huge core arrivals.\nOur main objective in this work is switching from less efficient to a more\nefficient model and to characterize extreme behavior of core arrival in\nremanufacturing and applying the developed model to triage cores. Central\ntendency core flow models are not sufficient to handle extreme situations,\nhowever, complementary Extreme Value (EV) approaches have shown to improve\nmodel efficiency. Extreme core flows to remanufacturing facilities are rare but\nstill likely and can adversely affect remanufacturing business operations. In\nthis investigation, extreme end-of-use core flow is modelled by a threshold\napproach using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).

{"text": "Scalable computation for optimal control of cascade systems with constraints\n  A method is devised for numerically solving a class of finite-horizon optimal\ncontrol problems subject to cascade linear discrete-time dynamics. It is\nassumed that the linear state and input inequality constraints, and the\nquadratic measure of performance, are all separable with respect to the spatial\ndimension of the underlying cascade of sub-systems, as well as the temporal\ndimension of the dynamics. By virtue of this structure, the computation cost of\nan interior-point method for an equivalent quadratic programming formulation of\nthe optimal control problem can be made to scale linearly with the number of\nsub-systems. However, the complexity of this approach grows cubically with the\ntime horizon. As such, computational advantage becomes apparent in situations\nwhere the number of sub-systems is relatively large.

The proposed\napproach is based on the saddle point approximation to cumulative distribution\nfunction (CDF) as given by \\tit{Wood-Booth-Butler formula}. The approach is\napplicable whenever the cumulant generating function (CGF) of the received\nsignal and interference exists, and it allows us to tackle distributions with\nlarge skewness and kurtosis with higher accuracy. In this regard, we exploit a\nfour parameter \\tit{normal-inverse Gaussian} (NIG) distribution as a base\ndistribution.

The bijectivity of any encryption function,\ncrucial in order to make the decryption possible, is guaranteed by the use of\ninvertible layers or by the Feistel structure. In this work a new family of\nciphers, called wave ciphers, is introduced. In wave ciphers, round functions\nfeature wave functions, which are vectorial Boolean functions obtained as the\ncomposition of non-invertible layers, where the confusion layer enlarges the\nmessage which returns to its original size after the diffusion layer is\napplied.

The\nconditional limiting distribution of $\\Theta$ given $R$ is large characterizes\nthe tail dependence of the random vector and hence its estimation is the\nprimary goal of applications. A typical strategy is to look at the angular\ncomponents of the data for which the radial parts exceed some threshold. While\na large class of methods has been proposed to model the angular distribution\nfrom these exceedances, the choice of threshold has been scarcely discussed in\nthe literature. In this paper, we describe a procedure for choosing the\nthreshold by formally testing the independence of $R$ and $\\Theta$ using a\nmeasure of dependence called distance covariance.

The combination\nof excluded-volume interactions and self-propulsion leads to several distinct\ndynamic phases as a function of bending rigidity, activity, and aspect ratio of\nindividual filaments. We consider first the case of intermediate filament\ndensity. For high-aspect-ratio filaments, we identify a transition with\nincreasing propulsion from a state of free-swimming filaments to a state of\nspiraled filaments with nearly frozen translational motion. For lower aspect\nratios, this gas-of-spirals phase is suppressed with growing density due to\nfilament collisions; instead, filaments form clusters similar to self-propelled\nrods, as activity increases. Finite bending rigidity strongly effects the\ndynamics and phase behavior. Flexible filaments form small and transient\nclusters, while stiffer filaments organize into giant clusters, similarly as\nself-propelled rods, but with a reentrant phase behavior from giant to smaller\nclusters as activity becomes large enough to bend the filaments. For high\nfilament densities, we identify a nearly frozen jamming state at low\nactivities, a nematic laning state at intermediate activities, and an\nactive-turbulence state at high activities. The latter state is characterized\nby a power-law decay of the energy spectrum as a function of wave number.

We propose a novel\nanalytical framework and show that under certain dual conditions, the optimal\nsolution of the matrix factorization program is the same as its bi-dual and\nthus the global optimality of the non-convex program can be achieved by solving\nits bi-dual which is convex.

The\nspectral character of these variations yields insight into the particle sizes\nand vertical structure of the clouds.

By simultaneously observing a nearby reference\nstar, we achieve <0.15% per-band sensitivity in relative brightness changes\nacross the 0.9--2.4um bandwidth. We find that 2MASS J0835-0819 exhibits\nmarginal (< ~0.5% per band) variability with no clear spectral dependence,\nwhile 2MASS J1821+1414 varies by up to +/-1.5% at 0.9 um, with the variability\namplitude declining toward longer wavelengths.

In this study, we applied connectometry, an advanced quantitative\nneuroimaging technique for investigating localised changes in white-matter\ntissue. Analysing white matter structures of 32 subjects we incorporated our\nfindings in a computational model of seizure dynamics to suggest a plausible\nmechanism of epileptogenesis. Patients with IGE have significant bilateral\nalterations in major white-matter fascicles. In the cingulum, fornix, and\nsuperior longitudinal fasciculus, tract integrity is compromised, whereas in\nspecific parts of tracts between thalamus and the precentral gyrus, tract\nintegrity is enhanced in patients. Combining these alterations in a logistic\nregression model, we computed the decision boundary that discriminated patients\nand controls.

However, this approach can be computationally demanding\nas it usually requires a large number of model evaluations. To address this\nissue, one can take advantage of surrogate modeling techniques. Nevertheless,\nwhen approximation error of the surrogate model is neglected in inverse\nmodeling, the inversion result will be biased. In this paper, we develop a\nsurrogate-based Bayesian inversion framework that explicitly quantifies and\ngradually reduces the approximation error of the surrogate. Specifically, two\nstrategies are proposed and compared. The first strategy works by obtaining an\nensemble of sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) surrogates with Markov\nchain Monte Carlo sampling, while the second one uses Gaussian process (GP) to\nsimulate the approximation error of a single sparse PCE surrogate. The two\nstrategies can also be applied with other surrogates, thus they have general\napplicability. By adaptively refining the surrogate over the posterior\ndistribution, we can gradually reduce the surrogate approximation error to a\nsmall level. Demonstrated with three case studies involving\nhigh-dimensionality, multi-modality and a real-world application, respectively,\nit is found that both strategies can reduce the bias introduced by surrogate\nmodeling, while the second strategy has a better performance as it integrates\ntwo methods (i.e., sparse PCE and GP) that complement each other.\n", "pos": 5.4781451447965965}

The consequence is that they do not admit quotient types.\nThis is, of course, often inconvenient. Whenever a computation involves data\nwith multiple representatives, and they need to be identified according to some\nequations that are not satisfied by all data, the monadic programmer has to\nleave the universe of free algebras, and resort to explicit destructors. We\ncharacterize the situation when these destructors are preserved under all\noperations, and the resulting quotients of free algebras are also their\nsubalgebras.

We find that the\ncrust is preferentially lost relative to the mantle during impacts, and we have\ndeveloped a scaling law that approximates the mass of crust that remains in the\nlargest remnant. Using this scaling law and a recent set of N-body simulations,\nwe have estimated the maximum effect of crustal stripping on incompatible\nelement abundances during the accretion of planetary embryos. We find that on\naverage one third of the initial crust is stripped from embryos as they\naccrete, which leads to a reduction of ~20% in the budgets of the heat\nproducing elements if the stripped crust does not reaccrete. Erosion of crusts\ncan lead to non-chondritic ratios of incompatible elements, but the magnitude\nof this effect depends sensitively on the details of the crust-forming melting\nprocess.

To apply the methods of functional time series\nanalysis to such observations, we should first embed them in a linear space in\nwhich the essential properties of densities are preserved under addition and\nscalar multiplication. Bayes Hilbert spaces provide one way to achieve this\nembedding. In this paper we investigate the use of Bayes Hilbert spaces to\nmodel cointegrated density-valued linear processes. We develop an I(1)\nrepresentation theory for cointegrated linear processes in a Bayes Hilbert\nspace, and adapt existing statistical procedures for estimating the\ncorresponding attractor space to a Bayes Hilbert space setting. We revisit\nempirical applications involving earnings and wage densities to illustrate the\nutility of our approach.\n", "pos": 5.392461492123719}

As command and control centres, they are\nhome to the headquarters of the most powerful MNCs of the global economy, while\nas sites for the production of innovation they are supposed to be the most\nimportant sites of corporate research and development (R&D) activities.

In this work, we present\nthe first rational, metacognitive account of the Availability bias, formally\narticulated at Marr's algorithmic level of analysis. Concretely, we present a\nnormative, metacognitive model of how a cognitive system should over-represent\nextreme eventualities, depending on the amount of time available at its\ndisposal for decision-making. Our model also accounts for two well-known\nframing effects in human decision-making under risk---the fourfold pattern of\nrisk preferences in outcome probability (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) and in\noutcome magnitude (Markovitz, 1952)---thereby providing the first\nmetacognitively-rational basis for those effects. Empirical evidence,\nfurthermore, confirms an important prediction of our model. Surprisingly, our\nmodel is unimaginably robust with respect to its focal parameter. We discuss\nthe implications of our work for studies on human decision-making, and conclude\nby presenting a counterintuitive prediction of our model, which, if confirmed,\nwould have intriguing implications for human decision-making under risk.

Using the large-dimensional random matrix theory, it\nhas been established that the eigenvalue distribution of the PA-RCov matrix is\nintimately linked to that of the ICV through the Marcenko-Pastur equation.\nConsequently, the spectrum of the ICV can be inferred from that of the PA-RCov.\nHowever, extensive data analyses demonstrate that the spectrum of the PA-RCov\nis spiked, that is, a few large eigenvalues (spikes) stay away from the others\nwhich form a rather continuous distribution with a density function (bulk).\nTherefore, any inference on the ICVs must take into account this spiked\nstructure. As a methodological contribution, we propose a spiked model for the\nICVs where spikes can be inferred from those of the available PA-RCov matrices.\nThe consistency of the inference procedure is established and is checked by\nextensive simulation studies. In addition, we apply our method to the real data\nfrom the US and Hong Kong markets.

The\ntechnique overcomes some of the cost limitations of turbulence simulation,\nsince the main flow is treated with a coarse-grid LES, with the equivalent of\nwall functions supplied by the near-wall sampled QDNS. Two cases are tested, at\nfriction Reynolds number Re$_\\tau$=4200 and 20,000. The total grid node count\nfor the first case is less than half a million and less than two million for\nthe second case, with the calculations only requiring a desktop computer. A\ngood agreement with published DNS is found at Re$_\\tau$=4200, both in terms of\nthe mean velocity profile and the streamwise velocity fluctuation statistics,\nwhich correctly show a substantial increase in near-wall turbulence levels due\nto a modulation of near-wall streaks by large-scale structures.

It is well\nknown that the algorithm works well in the random \\emph{planted bisection\nmodel} -- the standard class of graphs for analysis minimum bisection and\nrelevant problems. In 2001 Feige and Kilian posed the question if Boppana's\nalgorithm works well in the semirandom model by Blum and Spencer. In our paper\nwe answer this question affirmatively. We show also that the algorithm achieves\nsimilar performance on graph classes which extend the semirandom model.\nSince the behavior of Boppana's algorithm on the semirandom graphs remained\nunknown, Feige and Kilian proposed a new semidefinite programming (SDP) based\napproach and proved that it works on this model. The relationship between the\nperformance of the SDP based algorithm and Boppana's approach was left as an\nopen problem. In this paper we solve the problem in a complete way by proving\nthat the bisection algorithm of Feige and Kilian provides exactly the same\nresults as Boppana's algorithm. As a consequence we get that Boppana's\nalgorithm achieves the optimal threshold for exact cluster recovery in the\n\\emph{stochastic block model}.

The density of states is enhanced due to an increase of\nthe effective mass of atoms. In deep lattices the scattering amplitude is\nstrongly reduced compared to free space due to a small overlap of wavefunctions\nof fermion sitting in the neighboring lattice sites, which suppresses the\np-wave superfluidity.

{"text": "On the Reliable Detection of Concept Drift from Streaming Unlabeled Data\n  Classifiers deployed in the real world operate in a dynamic environment,\nwhere the data distribution can change over time. These changes, referred to as\nconcept drift, can cause the predictive performance of the classifier to drop\nover time, thereby making it obsolete. To be of any real use, these classifiers\nneed to detect drifts and be able to adapt to them, over time. Detecting drifts\nhas traditionally been approached as a supervised task, with labeled data\nconstantly being used for validating the learned model. Although effective in\ndetecting drifts, these techniques are impractical, as labeling is a difficult,\ncostly and time consuming activity. On the other hand, unsupervised change\ndetection techniques are unreliable, as they produce a large number of false\nalarms. The inefficacy of the unsupervised techniques stems from the exclusion\nof the characteristics of the learned classifier, from the detection process.\nIn this paper, we propose the Margin Density Drift Detection (MD3) algorithm,\nwhich tracks the number of samples in the uncertainty region of a classifier,\nas a metric to detect drift. The MD3 algorithm is a distribution independent,\napplication independent, model independent, unsupervised and incremental\nalgorithm for reliably detecting drifts from data streams. Experimental\nevaluation on 6 drift induced datasets and 4 additional datasets from the\ncybersecurity domain demonstrates that the MD3 approach can reliably detect\ndrifts, with significantly fewer false alarms compared to unsupervised feature\nbased drift detectors.

It incorporates Euler-Lagrange\nequations that are in essential agreement with the Navier-Stokes equation, but\napplicable to the general case of a compressible fluid. The variational\nprinciple incorporates the equation of continuity, a canonical structure and a\nconserved Hamiltonian. The density is compressible, characterized by a general\n(non-polar) equation of state, and homogeneous. The onset of instability is\noften accompanied by bubble formation.

{"text": "Discovery of Important Subsequences in Electrocardiogram Beats Using the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm\n  The classification of time series data is a well-studied problem with\nnumerous practical applications, such as medical diagnosis and speech\nrecognition. A popular and effective approach is to classify new time series in\nthe same way as their nearest neighbours, whereby proximity is defined using\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance, a measure analogous to sequence alignment\nin bioinformatics. However, practitioners are not only interested in accurate\nclassification, they are also interested in why a time series is classified a\ncertain way. To this end, we introduce here the problem of finding a minimum\nlength subsequence of a time series, the removal of which changes the outcome\nof the classification under the nearest neighbour algorithm with DTW distance.\nInformally, such a subsequence is expected to be relevant for the\nclassification and can be helpful for practitioners in interpreting the\noutcome. We describe a simple but optimized implementation for detecting these\nsubsequences and define an accompanying measure to quantify the relevance of\nevery time point in the time series for the classification. In tests on\nelectrocardiogram data we show that the algorithm allows discovery of important\nsubsequences and can be helpful in detecting abnormalities in cardiac rhythms\ndistinguishing sick from healthy patients.\n", "pos": 5.248021821428268}

Two of these correspond\nto the values of the gap functions and the third one depends on both the gaps\nand the transfer momentum. We argue that only the singularity near the smallest\nband gap may be used as an universal tool to distinguish between $s_{++}$ and\n$s_{\\pm}$ order parameters. The robustness of the sign of the response function\npeak near the smaller gap value, irrespective of the change in parameters, in\nboth the symmetry cases is a promising feature that can be harnessed\nexperimentally.\n", "pos": 5.4284563211844175}

{"text": "Gradient-enhanced kriging for high-dimensional problems\n  Surrogate models provide a low computational cost alternative to evaluating\nexpensive functions. The construction of accurate surrogate models with large\nnumbers of independent variables is currently prohibitive because it requires a\nlarge number of function evaluations. Gradient-enhanced kriging has the\npotential to reduce the number of function evaluations for the desired accuracy\nwhen efficient gradient computation, such as an adjoint method, is available.\nHowever, current gradient-enhanced kriging methods do not scale well with the\nnumber of sampling points due to the rapid growth in the size of the\ncorrelation matrix where new information is added for each sampling point in\neach direction of the design space. They do not scale well with the number of\nindependent variables either due to the increase in the number of\nhyperparameters that needs to be estimated. To address this issue, we develop a\nnew gradient-enhanced surrogate model approach that drastically reduced the\nnumber of hyperparameters through the use of the partial-least squares method\nthat maintains accuracy.

Although most recent\naction recognition methods are based on Recurrent Neural Networks which present\noutstanding performance, one of the shortcomings of these methods is the\ntendency to overemphasize the temporal information. Since 3D convolutional\nneural network(3D CNN) is a powerful tool to simultaneously learn features from\nboth spatial and temporal dimensions through capturing the correlations between\nthree dimensional signals, this paper proposes a novel two-stream model using\n3D CNN. To our best knowledge, this is the first application of 3D CNN in\nskeleton-based action recognition. Our method consists of three stages. First,\nskeleton joints are mapped into a 3D coordinate space and then encoding the\nspatial and temporal information, respectively. Second, 3D CNN models are\nseperately adopted to extract deep features from two streams. Third, to enhance\nthe ability of deep features to capture global relationships, we extend every\nstream into multitemporal version.

We investigate the day side temperature and orbital eccentricity\nusing secondary eclipse observations with Spitzer. We observed the secondary\neclipse with Spitzer/IRAC in subarray mode, in both 3.6 and 4.5 micron\nwavelengths. We used pixel-level decorrelation to correct for Spitzer's\nintra-pixel sensitivity variations and thereby obtain accurate eclipse depths\nand central phases. Our 3.6 micron eclipse depth is 0.149 +/- 0.051% and the\n4.5 micron depth is 0.273 +/- 0.049%. Fitting a blackbody planet to our data\nand two recent Ks band eclipse depths indicates a brightness temperature of\n1506 +/- 71K.

The day side temperature of the planet is unlikely\nto be as high (1885K) as indicated by the ground-based eclipses in the Ks band,\nunless the planet's emergent spectrum deviates strongly from model atmosphere\npredictions.

{"text": "Method of Reduction of Variables for Bilinear Matrix Inequality Problems in System and Control Designs\n  Bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) problems in system and control designs are\ninvestigated in this paper. A solution method of reduction of variables (MRVs)\nis proposed. This method consists of a principle of variable classification, a\nprocedure for problem transformation, and a hybrid algorithm that combines\ndeterministic and stochastic search engines. The classification principle is\nused to classify the decision variables of a BMI problem into two categories:\n1) external and 2) internal variables. Theoretical analysis is performed to\nshow that when the classification principle is applicable, a BMI problem can be\ntransformed into an unconstrained optimization problem that has fewer decision\nvariables. Stochastic search and deterministic search are then applied to\ndetermine the decision variables of the unconstrained problem externally and\nexplore the internal problem structure, respectively. The proposed method can\naddress feasibility, single-objective, and multiobjective problems constrained\nby BMIs in a unified manner. A number of numerical examples in system and\ncontrol designs are provided to validate the proposed methodology.

{"text": "Long ties accelerate noisy threshold-based contagions\n  Changes to network structure can substantially affect when and how widely new\nideas, products, and conventions are adopted. In models of biological\ncontagion, interventions that randomly rewire edges (making them \"longer\")\naccelerate spread. However, there are other models relevant to social\ncontagion, such as those motivated by myopic best-response in games with\nstrategic complements, in which individual's behavior is described by a\nthreshold number of adopting neighbors above which adoption occurs (i.e.,\ncomplex contagions). Recent work has argued that highly clustered, rather than\nrandom, networks facilitate spread of these complex contagions. Here we show\nthat minor modifications of prior analyses, which make them more realistic,\nreverse this result. The modification is that we allow very rarely below\nthreshold adoption, i.e., very rarely adoption occurs, where there is only one\nadopting neighbor. To model the trade-off between long and short edges we\nconsider networks that are the union of cycle-power-$k$ graphs and random\ngraphs on $n$ nodes. We study how the time to global spread changes as we\nreplace the cycle edges with (random) long ties. Allowing adoptions below\nthreshold to occur with order $1/\\sqrt{n}$ probability is enough to ensure that\nrandom rewiring accelerates spread. Simulations illustrate the robustness of\nthese results to other commonly-posited models for noisy best-response\nbehavior. We then examine empirical social networks, where we find that\nhypothetical interventions that (a) randomly rewire existing edges or (b) add\nrandom edges reduce time to spread compared with the original network or\naddition of \"short\", triad-closing edges, respectively. This substantially\nrevises conclusions about how interventions change the spread of behavior,\nsuggesting that those wanting to increase spread should induce formation of\nlong ties, rather than triad-closing ties.\n", "pos": 5.37872346550152}

In this paper, we deal with matrices\nthat are not necessarily low rank themselves, but rather they contain low-rank\nsubmatrices. We propose Targeted, which is a general framework for completing\nsuch matrices. In this framework, we first extract the low-rank submatrices and\nthen apply a matrix-completion algorithm to these low-rank submatrices as well\nas the remainder matrix separately.

To couple the macroscopic rheology of polymeric fluids and the\nmicroscale dynamics of polymer chains, the continuum approach (based on the\nfinite volume method) provides the transient flow field as inputs for the\n(mesoscopic) dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), and in turn DPD returns an\neffective constitutive relation to close the continuum equations. In this\nmultiscale modeling procedure, we employ an active learning strategy based on\nGaussian process regression (GPR) to minimize the number of expensive DPD\nsimulations, where adaptively selected DPD simulations are performed only as\nnecessary. Numerical experiments are carried out for flow past a circular\ncylinder of a non-Newtonian fluid, modeled at the mesoscopic level by\nbead-spring chains.

{"text": "Targeted Undersmoothing\n  This paper proposes a post-model selection inference procedure, called\ntargeted undersmoothing, designed to construct uniformly valid confidence sets\nfor a broad class of functionals of sparse high-dimensional statistical models.\nThese include dense functionals, which may potentially depend on all elements\nof an unknown high-dimensional parameter. The proposed confidence sets are\nbased on an initially selected model and two additionally selected models, an\nupper model and a lower model, which enlarge the initially selected model. We\nillustrate application of the procedure in two empirical examples.

However, a number of omics data are metrizable,\ni.e., they can be endowed with a metric structure, enabling to adopt a\nconvolutional based deep learning framework, e.g., for prediction.

{"text": "Automated Website Fingerprinting through Deep Learning\n  Several studies have shown that the network traffic that is generated by a\nvisit to a website over Tor reveals information specific to the website through\nthe timing and sizes of network packets. By capturing traffic traces between\nusers and their Tor entry guard, a network eavesdropper can leverage this\nmeta-data to reveal which website Tor users are visiting. The success of such\nattacks heavily depends on the particular set of traffic features that are used\nto construct the fingerprint. Typically, these features are manually engineered\nand, as such, any change introduced to the Tor network can render these\ncarefully constructed features ineffective. In this paper, we show that an\nadversary can automate the feature engineering process, and thus automatically\ndeanonymize Tor traffic by applying our novel method based on deep learning. We\ncollect a dataset comprised of more than three million network traces, which is\nthe largest dataset of web traffic ever used for website fingerprinting, and\nfind that the performance achieved by our deep learning approaches is\ncomparable to known methods which include various research efforts spanning\nover multiple years.

However, it is a\nchallenge to feedback diversity information to developers and testers since\nresults are typically many-dimensional.

In this paper we propose a Meta learning framework, based on data\nset aggregation, to improve generalization of imitation learning algorithms.\nUnder the proposed framework, we propose MetaDAgger, a novel algorithm which\ntackles the generalization issues in traditional imitation learning. We use The\nOpen Race Car Simulator (TORCS) to test our algorithm. Results on unseen test\ntracks show significant improvement over traditional imitation learning\nalgorithms, improving the learning time and sample efficiency in the same time.\nThe results are also supported by visualization of the learnt features to prove\ngeneralization of the captured details.\n", "pos": 5.172451411096068}

To further broaden the use of ML models, cloud-based services\noffered by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others have developed ML-as-a-service\ntools as black-box systems. However, ML classifiers are vulnerable to\nadversarial examples: inputs that are maliciously modified can cause the\nclassifier to provide adversary-desired outputs. Moreover, it is known that\nadversarial examples generated on one classifier are likely to cause another\nclassifier to make the same mistake, even if the classifiers have different\narchitectures or are trained on disjoint datasets. This property, which is\nknown as transferability, opens up the possibility of attacking black-box\nsystems by generating adversarial examples on a substitute classifier and\ntransferring the examples to the target classifier. Therefore, the key to\nprotect black-box learning systems against the adversarial examples is to block\ntheir transferability. To this end, we propose a training method that, as the\ninput is more perturbed, the classifier smoothly outputs lower confidence on\nthe original label and instead predicts that the input is \"invalid\".

This leads to\nthe notion of the {\\em conformal growth exponent of $(G,\\rho)$}, which is the\nbest asymptotic degree of volume growth of balls that can be achieved by such a\nreweighting. Under moment conditions on the degree of the root, we show that\nthe conformal growth exponent of a unimodular random graph bounds the almost\nsure spectral dimension.\nIn two dimensions, one obtains more precise information. If $(G,\\rho)$ has a\nproperty we call {\\em quadratic conformal growth}, then the following holds: If\nthe degree of the root is uniformly bounded almost surely, then $G$ is almost\nsurely recurrent. Since limits of finite $H$-minor-free graphs have gauged\nquadratic conformal growth, such limits are almost surely recurrent; this\naffirms a conjecture of Benjamini and Schramm (2001). For the special case of\nplanar graphs, this gives a proof of the Benjamini-Schramm Recurrence Theorem\nthat does not proceed via the analysis of circle packings.\nGurel-Gurevich and Nachmias (2013) resolved a central open problem by showing\nthat the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT) and quadrangulation\n(UIPQ) are almost surely recurrent. They proved that this holds for any\ndistributional limit of planar graphs in which the degree of the root has\nexponential tails (which is known to hold for UIPT and UIPQ). We use the\nquadratic conformal growth property to give a new proof of this result that\nholds for distributional limits of finite $H$-minor-free graphs. Moreover, our\narguments yield quantitative bounds on the heat kernel in terms of the degree\ndistribution at the root. This also yields a new approach to subdiffusivity of\nthe random walk on UIPT/UIPQ, using only the volume growth profile of balls in\nthe intrinsic metric.\n", "pos": 5.691728937479214}
{"text": "Structured signal recovery from quadratic measurements: Breaking sample complexity barriers via nonconvex optimization\n  This paper concerns the problem of recovering an unknown but structured\nsignal $x \\in R^n$ from $m$ quadratic measurements of the form\n$y_r=|<a_r,x>|^2$ for $r=1,2,...,m$. We focus on the under-determined setting\nwhere the number of measurements is significantly smaller than the dimension of\nthe signal ($m<<n$). We formulate the recovery problem as a nonconvex\noptimization problem where prior structural information about the signal is\nenforced through constrains on the optimization variables. We prove that\nprojected gradient descent, when initialized in a neighborhood of the desired\nsignal, converges to the unknown signal at a linear rate. These results hold\nfor any constraint set (convex or nonconvex) providing convergence guarantees\nto the global optimum even when the objective function and constraint set is\nnonconvex. Furthermore, these results hold with a number of measurements that\nis only a constant factor away from the minimal number of measurements required\nto uniquely identify the unknown signal. Our results provide the first provably\ntractable algorithm for this data-poor regime, breaking local sample complexity\nbarriers that have emerged in recent literature. In a companion paper we\ndemonstrate favorable properties for the optimization problem that may enable\nsimilar results to continue to hold more globally (over the entire ambient\nspace).

A self-consistent analysis of 20 years of VLBI monitoring\n  The nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) Arp 220 is an excellent\nlaboratory for studies of extreme astrophysical environments. For 20 years,\nVery Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has been used to monitor a population\nof compact sources thought to be supernovae (SNe), supernova remnants (SNRs)\nand possibly active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using new and archival VLBI data\nspanning 20 years, we obtain 23 high-resolution radio images of Arp 220 at\nwavelengths from 18 cm to 2 cm. From model-fitting to the images we obtain\nestimates of flux densities and sizes of all detected sources. We detect radio\ncontinuum emission from 97 compact sources and present flux densities and sizes\nfor all analysed observation epochs. We find evidence for a LD-relation within\nArp 220, with larger sources being less luminous. We find a compact source LF\n$n(L)\\propto L^\\beta$ with $\\beta=-2.02\\pm0.11$, similar to SNRs in normal\ngalaxies.

The observations can be\nexplained by a mixed population of SNe and SNRs, where the former expand in a\ndense circumstellar medium (CSM) and the latter interact with the surrounding\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Several sources (9 of the 94 with fitted sizes) are\nlikely luminous, type IIn SNe. This number of luminous SNe correspond to few\npercent of the total number of SNe in Arp 220 which is consistent with a total\nSN-rate of 4 yr$^{-1}$ as inferred from the total radio emission given a normal\nstellar initial mass function (IMF).

As analysis methods are often unable to cope with so many\ndimensions, it is common to use dimensionality reduction and clustering methods\nto reach a reduced representation of the data. Yet these methods often fail to\ncapture the most important features necessary for the construction of a Markov\nmodel. Here we demonstrate the results of various dimensionality reduction\nmethods on two simulation data-sets, one of protein folding and another of\nprotein-ligand binding.

The\ndimension-reduced data is then used to estimate the implied timescales of the\nslowest process by a Markov state model analysis to assess the quality of the\nprojection. The projected dimensions learned from the data are visualized to\ndemonstrate which conformations the various methods choose to represent the\nmolecular process.\n", "pos": 5.694424697518352}

We showed previously that in the solar case it induces RV variations\nwith an amplitude over the cycle on the order of 8 m/s, with signals on short\nand long timescales. The major component is the inhibition of the convective\nblueshift due to plages. We explore a new approach to correct for this major\ncomponent of stellar radial velocities in the case of solar-type stars. The\nconvective blueshift depends on line depths; we use this property to develop a\nmethod that will characterize the amplitude of this effect and to correct for\nthis RV component. We build realistic RV time series corresponding to RVs\ncomputed using different sets of lines, including lines in different depth\nranges. We characterize the performance of the method used to reconstruct the\nsignal without the convective component and the detection limits derived from\nthe residuals. We identified a set of lines which, combined with a global set\nof lines, allows us to reconstruct the convective component with a good\nprecision and to correct for it.

{"text": "Comparison of Flow Scheduling Policies for Mix of Regular and Deadline Traffic in Datacenter Environments\n  Datacenters are the main infrastructure on top of which cloud computing\nservices are offered. Such infrastructure may be shared by a large number of\ntenants and applications generating a spectrum of datacenter traffic. Delay\nsensitive applications and applications with specific Service Level Agreements\n(SLAs), generate deadline constrained flows, while other applications initiate\nflows that are desired to be delivered as early as possible. As a result,\ndatacenter traffic is a mix of two types of flows: deadline and regular. There\nare several scheduling policies for either traffic type with focus on\nminimizing completion times or deadline miss rate. In this report, we apply\nseveral scheduling policies to mix traffic scenario while varying the ratio of\nregular to deadline traffic. We consider FCFS (First Come First Serve), SRPT\n(Shortest Remaining Processing Time) and Fair Sharing as deadline agnostic\napproaches and a combination of Earliest Deadline First (EDF) with either FCFS\nor SRPT as deadline-aware schemes. In addition, for the latter, we consider\nboth cases of prioritizing deadline traffic (Deadline First) and prioritizing\nregular traffic (Deadline Last). We study both light-tailed and heavy-tailed\nflow size distributions and measure mean, median and tail flow completion times\n(FCT) for regular flows along with Deadline Miss Rate (DMR) and average\nlateness for deadline flows. We also consider two operation regimes of\nlightly-loaded (low utilization) and heavily-loaded (high utilization). We find\nthat performance of deadline-aware schemes is highly dependent on fraction of\ndeadline traffic. With light-tailed flow sizes, we find that FCFS performs\nbetter in terms of tail times and average lateness while SRPT performs better\nin average times and deadline miss rate. For heavy-tailed flow sizes, except\nfor tail times, SRPT performs better in all other metrics.\n", "pos": 5.163806134950988}

The P-W SDP has been\nshown in the literature to have good statistical properties in a variety of\nsettings, but remains intractable to solve in practice.

Most of these costs results from chemical equilibrium\ncalculations that are performed at least once in every mesh cell and at every\ntime step of the simulation. Calculating chemical equilibrium is an iterative\nprocess, where each iteration is in general so computationally expensive that\neven if every calculation converged in a single iteration, the resulting\nspeedup would not be significant. Thus, rather than proposing a fast-converging\nnumerical method for solving chemical equilibrium equations, we present a\nmachine learning method that enables new equilibrium states to be quickly and\naccurately estimated, whenever a previous equilibrium calculation with similar\ninput conditions has been performed. We demonstrate the use of this smart\nchemical equilibrium method in a reactive transport modeling example and show\nthat, even at early simulation times, the majority of all equilibrium\ncalculations are quickly predicted and, after some time steps, the\nmachine-learning-accelerated chemical solver has been fully trained to rapidly\nperform all subsequent equilibrium calculations, resulting in speedups of\nalmost two orders of magnitude.

{"text": "Hypergraph $p$-Laplacian: A Differential Geometry View\n  The graph Laplacian plays key roles in information processing of relational\ndata, and has analogies with the Laplacian in differential geometry. In this\npaper, we generalize the analogy between graph Laplacian and differential\ngeometry to the hypergraph setting, and propose a novel hypergraph\n$p$-Laplacian.

Moreover, we propose a semi-supervised\nlearning method based on the proposed hypergraph $p$-Laplacian, and formalize\nthem as the analogue to the Dirichlet problem, which often appears in physics.\nWe further explore theoretical connections to normalized hypergraph cut on a\nhypergraph, and propose normalized cut corresponding to hypergraph\n$p$-Laplacian.

In\nthe no-slip scenario, the early time Reynolds stress divergence within the\nviscous boundary layer is much stronger than within the bulk while also driving\nflow in the opposite direction. Whatever the boundary condition, boundary\nstreaming is however dominated by bulk streaming at a larger time.

Given noisy\nobservations of a small, random subset of the matrix entries, our goal is to\nestimate the unobserved entries of the matrix as well as to \"de-noise\" the\nobserved entries.\nAs the main result of this work, we introduce a neighbor-based estimation\nalgorithm inspired by the classical Taylor's series expansion.

As an important byproduct, our analysis sheds light into\nthe performance of the classical collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm for\nmatrix completion, which has been widely utilized in practice. Experiments with\nthe MovieLens and Netflix datasets suggest that our algorithm provides a\nprincipled improvement over basic CF and is competitive with matrix\nfactorization methods.\nOur algorithm has a natural extension to tensor completion.

Using the NYC taxi dataset, which\ncontains taxi trips data collected from GPS-enabled taxis [23], this paper\ninvestigates the use of deep neural networks to jointly predict taxi trip time\nand distance. We propose a model, called ST-NN (Spatio-Temporal Neural\nNetwork), which first predicts the travel distance between an origin and a\ndestination GPS coordinate, then combines this prediction with the time of day\nto predict the travel time. The beauty of ST-NN is that it uses only the raw\ntrips data without requiring further feature engineering and provides a joint\nestimate of travel time and distance. We compare the performance of ST-NN to\nthat of state-of-the-art travel time estimation methods, and we observe that\nthe proposed approach generalizes better than state-of-the-art methods. We show\nthat ST-NN approach significantly reduces the mean absolute error for both\npredicted travel time and distance, about 17% for travel time prediction.

We propose such FT surrogates as a novel tool to augment and\nanalyze training of neural networks and explore the approach in the example of\nsleep-stage classification. By computing FT surrogates of raw EEG, EOG, and EMG\nsignals of under-represented sleep stages, we balanced the CAPSLPDB sleep\ndatabase. We then trained and tested a convolutional neural network for sleep\nstage classification, and found that our surrogate-based augmentation improved\nthe mean F1-score by 7%. As another application of FT surrogates, we formulated\nan approach to compute saliency maps for individual sleep epochs. The\nvisualization is based on the response of inferred class probabilities under\nreplacement of short data segments by partial surrogates. To quantify how well\nthe distributions of the surrogates and the original data match, we evaluated a\ntrained classifier on surrogates of correctly classified examples, and\nsummarized these conditional predictions in a confusion matrix. We show how\nsuch conditional confusion matrices can qualitatively explain the performance\nof surrogates in class balancing.

The key notion in this paper is that of an agent a\nbelieving P conditionally on having information Q, where it is assumed that Q\nis compatible with what a knows.\nConditional neighbourhood logic can be viewed as a core system for reasoning\nabout subjective plausibility that is not yet committed to an interpretation in\nterms of numerical probability. Indeed, every weighted Kripke model gives rise\nto a conditional neighbourhood model, but not vice versa. We show that our\ncalculus for conditional neighbourhood logic is sound but not complete for\nweighted Kripke models. Next, we show how to extend the calculus to get\ncompleteness for the class of weighted Kripke models.\nNeighbourhood models for conditional belief are closed under model\nrestriction (public announcement update), while earlier neighbourhood models\nfor belief as `willingness to bet' were not. Therefore the logic we present\nimproves on earlier neighbourhood logics for belief and knowledge.

{"text": "Incorporating genuine prior information about between-study heterogeneity in random effects pairwise and network meta-analyses\n  Background: Pairwise and network meta-analyses using fixed effect and random\neffects models are commonly applied to synthesise evidence from randomised\ncontrolled trials. The models differ in their assumptions and the\ninterpretation of the results. The model choice depends on the objective of the\nanalysis and knowledge of the included studies. Fixed effect models are often\nused because there are too few studies with which to estimate the between-study\nstandard deviation from the data alone. Objectives: The aim is to propose a\nframework for eliciting an informative prior distribution for the between-study\nstandard deviation in a Bayesian random effects meta-analysis model to\ngenuinely represent heterogeneity when data are sparse. Methods: We developed\nan elicitation method using external information such as empirical evidence and\nexperts' beliefs on the 'range' of treatment effects in order to infer the\nprior distribution for the between-study standard deviation.

{"text": "Highly Viscous Microjet Generator\n  This paper describes a simple yet novel system for generating a highly\nviscous microjet. The jet is produced inside a wettable thin tube partially\nsubmerged in a liquid. The gas-liquid interface inside the tube, which is\ninitially concave, is kept much deeper than that outside the tube. An impulsive\nforce applied at the bottom of a liquid container leads to significant\nacceleration of the liquid inside the tube followed by flow-focusing due to the\nconcave interface. The jet generation process can be divided into two parts\nthat occur in different time scales, i.e. the Impact time (impact duration $\\le\nO(10^{-4})$ s) and Focusing time (focusing duration $\\gg O(10^{-4})$ s). In\nImpact time, the liquid accelerates suddenly due to the impact. In Focusing\ntime, the microjet emerges due to flow-focusing. In order to explain the sudden\nacceleration inside the tube in Impact time, we develop a physical model based\non a pressure impulse approach. Numerical simulations confirm the proposed\nmodel, indicating that the basic mechanism of the acceleration of the liquid\ndue to the impulsive force is elucidated. Remarkably, the viscous effect is\nnegligible in Impact time. In contrast, in Focusing time, the viscosity plays\nan important role in the microjet generation. We experimentally and numerically\ninvestigate the velocity of microjets with various viscosities. We find that\nhigher viscosities lead to reduction of the jet velocity, which can be\ndescribed by using Reynolds number (the ratio between the inertia force and the\nviscous force). This novel device may be a starting point for next-generation\ntechnologies, such as high-viscosity inkjet printers including bioprinters and\nneedle-free injection devices for minimally invasive medical treatments.\n", "pos": 5.132501943627954}

The question is formalized using valence automata, an\nabstract model of automata in which the storage mechanism is given by a monoid.\nFor each of a variety of storage mechanisms, one can choose a (typically\ninfinite) monoid $M$ such that valence automata over $M$ are equivalent to\n(one-way) automata with this type of storage. In fact, many important storage\nmechanisms can be realized by monoids defined by finite graphs, called graph\nmonoids. Examples include pushdown stacks, partially blind counters (which\nbehave like Petri net places), blind counters (which may attain negative\nvalues), and combinations thereof.\nHence, we study for which graph monoids the emptiness problem for valence\nautomata is decidable. A particular model realized by graph monoids is that of\nPetri nets with a pushdown stack. For these, decidability is a long-standing\nopen question and we do not answer it here.\nHowever, if one excludes subgraphs corresponding to this model, a\ncharacterization can be achieved. Moreover, we provide a description of those\nstorage mechanisms for which decidability remains open.

DIC relies on nonlinear optimization method.\nThus an initial guess is quite important due to its influence on the converge\ncharacteristics of the algorithm. In order to obtain a reliable, accurate\ninitial guess, a reliability-guided digital image correlation (RG-DIC) method,\nwhich is able to intelligently obtain a reliable initial guess without using\ntime-consuming integer-pixel registration, was proposed. However, the RG-DIC\nand its improved methods are path-dependent and cannot be fully parallelized.\nBesides, it is highly possible that RG-DIC fails in the full-field analysis of\ndeformation without manual intervention if the deformation fields contain large\nareas of discontinuous deformation. Feature-based initial guess is highly\nrobust while it is relatively time-consuming.

In this\npaper we view highness properties as mass problems, and compare them with\nrespect to Muchnik reducibility and its uniform strengthening, Medvedev\nreducibility.\nLet $\\mathcal D(p)$ be the mass problem of infinite bit sequences $y$ (i.e.,\n0,1 valued functions) such that for each computable bit sequence $x$, the\nasymptotic lower density $\\underline \\rho$ of the agreement bit sequence $x\n\\leftrightarrow y$ is at most $p$ (this sequence takes the value 1 at a bit\nposition iff $x$ and $y$ agree).\nWe show that all members of this family of mass problems parameterized by a\nreal $p$ with $0 < p<1/2 $ have the same complexity in the sense of Muchnik\nreducibility. This also yields a new version of Monin's affirmative answer to\nthe \"Gamma question\", whether $\\Gamma(A)< 1/2$ implies $\\Gamma(A)=0$ for each\nTuring oracle $A$.\nWe also show, together with Joseph Miller, that for any order function~$g$\nthere exists a faster growing order function $h $ such that $\\mathrm{IOE}(g) $\nis strictly Muchnik below $\\mathrm{IOE}(h)$.\nWe study cardinal characteristics analogous to the highness properties above.\nFor instance, $\\mathfrak d (p)$ is the least size of a set $G$ of bit sequences\nso that for each bit sequence $x$ there is a bit sequence $y$ in $G$ so that\n$\\underline \\rho (x \\leftrightarrow y) >p$. We prove within ZFC all the\ncoincidences of cardinal characteristics that are the analogs of the results\nabove.\n", "pos": 5.617543823497905}
{"text": "Dust radiative transfer modelling of the infrared ring around the magnetar SGR 1900$+$14\n  A peculiar infrared ring-like structure was discovered by {\\em Spitzer}\naround the strongly magnetised neutron star SGR 1900$+$14. This infrared\nstructure was suggested to be due to a dust-free cavity, produced by the SGR\nGiant Flare occurred in 1998, and kept illuminated by surrounding stars. Using\na 3D dust radiative transfer code, we aimed at reproducing the emission\nmorphology and the integrated emission flux of this structure assuming\ndifferent spatial distributions and densities for the dust, and different\npositions for the illuminating stars. We found that a dust-free ellipsoidal\ncavity can reproduce the shape, flux, and spectrum of the ring-like infrared\nemission, provided that the illuminating stars are inside the cavity and that\nthe interstellar medium has high gas density ($n_H\\sim$1000 cm$^{-3}$). We\nfurther constrain the emitting region to have a sharp inner boundary and to be\nsignificantly extended in the radial direction, possibly even just a cavity in\na smooth molecular cloud. We discuss possible scenarios for the formation of\nthe dustless cavity and the particular geometry that allows it to be IR-bright.\n", "pos": 5.302118825005896}
{"text": "The structure of multiplicative tilings of the real line\n  Suppose $\\Omega, A \\subseteq \\RR\\setminus\\Set{0}$ are two sets, both of mixed\nsign, that $\\Omega$ is Lebesgue measurable and $A$ is a discrete set. We study\nthe problem of when $A \\cdot \\Omega$ is a (multiplicative) tiling of the real\nline, that is when almost every real number can be uniquely written as a\nproduct $a\\cdot \\omega$, with $a \\in A$, $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. We study both the\nstructure of the set of multiples $A$ and the structure of the tile $\\Omega$.\nWe prove strong results in both cases. These results are somewhat analogous to\nthe known results about the structure of translational tiling of the real line.\nThere is, however, an extra layer of complexity due to the presence of sign in\nthe sets $A$ and $\\Omega$, which makes multiplicative tiling roughly equivalent\nto translational tiling on the larger group $\\ZZ_2 \\times \\RR$.\n", "pos": 5.661622111688356}
{"text": "Evolving imputation strategies for missing data in classification problems with TPOT\n  Missing data has a ubiquitous presence in real-life applications of machine\nlearning techniques. Imputation methods are algorithms conceived for restoring\nmissing values in the data, based on other entries in the database. The choice\nof the imputation method has an influence on the performance of the machine\nlearning technique, e.g., it influences the accuracy of the classification\nalgorithm applied to the data. Therefore, selecting and applying the right\nimputation method is important and usually requires a substantial amount of\nhuman intervention. In this paper we propose the use of genetic programming\ntechniques to search for the right combination of imputation and classification\nalgorithms. We build our work on the recently introduced Python-based TPOT\nlibrary, and incorporate a heterogeneous set of imputation algorithms as part\nof the machine learning pipeline search. We show that genetic programming can\nautomatically find increasingly better pipelines that include the most\neffective combinations of imputation methods, feature pre-processing, and\nclassifiers for a variety of classification problems with missing data.\n", "pos": 5.1783354838209394}
